### Useful resources

-   [Why use rem instead of px](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCSw6bPXZks) - This taught me
    a new best practice for responsive design.

-   [Use of clamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erqRw3E-vn4&t=202s) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand
    CSS clamp better. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
